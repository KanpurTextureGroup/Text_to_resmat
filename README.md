# Text_to_resmat
This matlab file converts the bulk texture data (*having Intensity vs two_theta in decending tilt angle in file*) to resmat file format. File converted is saved in .hpf file format, which is direct input to resmat (textools) software. Keep this file in the same folder having bulk texture data i.e. 111.txt , 220.txt etc. Just run this function. It will automatically read the filenames with extension txt and generate hpf file format. 
Donot keep standard Intensity vs two_theta data in the folder.
